- 👋 Hi, I’m @vancevince. I'm a junior at the University of South Carolina-Columbia studying Computer Information Systems. 
     I'm also a radio producer and host of All Things Considered for South Carolina Public Radio.
     
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming and development, and how I can incorporate more those into my current work.
     Most recently I used daily COVID data provided by SCDHEC to explore pandas and generate some simple graphics to visualize the information. 
     Also, I've jumped into JavaScript and JSNode, with my sights set on learning React. I'd also love to dive into 
     game development! I want to remake the side-scroller beat'em-up games of 80s and 90s.

- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in an introduction to computer networking, taught using C++, Java, and Python.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything web development or sports related. Web development because of the direct application
     to my current work. Sports because I love sports and would love to work on anything sports-adjacent.
