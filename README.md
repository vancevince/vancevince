- 👋 Hi, I’m @vancevince. I'm a junior at the University of South Carolina-Columbia studying Computer Information Systems. 
     I'm also a radio producer and host of All Things Considered for South Carolina Public Radio.
     
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming and development, and how I can incorporate more those into my current work.
     I definitly want to dive into JavaScript, JSNode, React, and all the modern languages and frameworks. I'd also love to dive into 
     game development! I want to remake the side-scroller beat'em-up games of 80s and 90s.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced programming techniques, taught using C++. I'm familiar with Java, Python, and Ruby. I've also 
     got a year of experience developing programs of moderate complexity in a UNIX environment.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything web development or sports related. Web development because of the direct application
     to my current work. Sports because I love sports and would love to work on anything sports-adjacent.
